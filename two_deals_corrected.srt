in summer twenty twenty six, leaving as, Every agent maybe after,

21
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:35,549
many stories on Frankie de Jong always, but weak is an important player.

22
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,236
Frankie de Jong even when we had all the stories on Manchester

23
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,837
United when was the manager.

24
00:01:40,515 --> 00:01:45,284

the city, he feels very comfortable in Barcelona, and now is really

26
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:53,334
important play with this new idea of football brought the new German coach.

27
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:57,787
Frankie de Jong wants to stay, Frankie de Jong sign contract in Barcelona.

00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:57,984
the ball agreement is done.

29
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:04,834
now they are exchanging all the documents lawyers player and clubside, to

30
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,305
get a new deal signed as soon as possible.

31
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:08,014
On clubside is already

32
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,159
Barcelona already approved everything and Counter signed everything,

33
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,365
depends on Frankie de Jong the timing, but the decision is already made.

34
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,750
Frankie sign contra Barcelona will be val until June twenty

35
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:25,199
twenty-nine, Frankie de Jong at Barcelona and everything verbally

36
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,376
agreed we just wait for the formal steps for the official pictures, for

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,312
the documents to be approved for the official statement all the procedure.

38
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:37,818
That follows a verbal agreement, but Frankie de Jong will be part of Barcelona

39
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,364
project and I think he's an excellent news for Barca, and especially part

40
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,391
of the Deco project, I always mention to you this, but the new Director of

41
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:48,110
Barcelona, now is a few years that there, but he's doing an important

42
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,698
job on extending the contract, that's really really really important for Deco.

43
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,322
Just try to calculate how many contacts the extended in Barcelona.

44
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:02,050
In in the recent, maybe in the last twelve months, maybe or contracts.

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,852
Barcelona is really important to keep control the players have at the club

46
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,881
to make sure they are comfortable

47
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,205
at the club andar correct for Barcelona financial play

48
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,959
and deal done for Frankie.

49
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:17,038
The Young.

50
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,509
My questions I'm getting guys is on Manchester United and manager situation,

51
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,170
what happens if United lose this weekend?

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,544
guys at the moment what I can tell you is that

53
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,270
Manchester United is not prepared.

54
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:30,626
Anything in case lose against Sunderland.

55
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:34,792
Man United don't have an agreement with another coach, Man United have

56
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:38,842
not officially contacted any other coach, Manchester United are not in

57
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:42,721
conversation in conversation with Gareth Southgate despite the reports.

58
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:46,793
I told you several times, Southgate an excellent relationship with Ios, but it

59
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:51,538
doesn't mean that is already agreed, it is already advanced that's the situation.

60
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,923
And at the moment for Manchester United guys, I can tell you that

61
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,822
the situation is still the same.

62
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,643
Focus on the games, support Ruben Amorim, try to get results because otherwise the

63
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:04,421
situation can't be safe for the Portuguese manager, but at the moment my United has

64
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,974
not prepared something, that Sunday something can already happen if they lose

65
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:10,385
the game against Sunderland this weekend.

66
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:13,862
M United keep focusing on the games and supporting the coach.

67
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:18,487
Than we have to see what happens but at the moment they have not prepared,

68
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:21,589
an emergency a contingency plan in case they lose the game this weekend.

69
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:25,204
keep supporting Ruben Amorim as their coach.

70
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:28,314
O Manchester United guys will not go to.

71
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,375
That's another update I can give you in general on the manager's market,

72
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,500
because Aliti had thought of four managers to replace Laurent Blanc,

73
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:40,637
they had conversations with Luciano Spalletti, they had conversations

74
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,843
with Xvi, they had conversations with Roger Smith, former Benfica

75
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,677
manager and they had conversations,

76
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:08,473
Sergio Conse race is Sergio Conse immediately to an agreement on the

77
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:09,149
contract lawyers club documents of the contract should be a Sergio Conse

78
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:09,511
Conse will be the boss of and that's an important important club Etihad

79
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:10,033
after the league last season, coach important players Karim Benzema,

80
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:17,045
it's important to mention That for Xavi Hernandez, Premier

81
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:19,161
League remains an ideal destination.

82
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:23,834
Xavi, I can confront to you would love to work in Premier League one day and

83
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:27,492
that day is as soon as possible, Xavi would be very happy about that.

84
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:32,151
Let's see what's gonna happen there, but trust me Chavi is studying the Premier

85
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:35,334
League, Chavi is ready to return as soon as possible, maybe it's gonna be in

86
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:36,540
Spain, in England, in Italy, whatever.

87
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,439
Chavis feels ready and studying the Premier League.

88
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:42,769
for sure Chavi will be more then happy to have an

89
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:44,593
opportunity in England, we see,

90
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,314
what's gonna happen there but the manager mar continues to move.

91
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,197
Sergio Fabio Cannavaro, former Ballon d'or, going to be manager of Uzbekistan.

92
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,413
I don't know if we have some Uzbekistan friend on our channel on YouTube,

93
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,980
Fabio Cannavaro will be the new head coach at the World Cup with Uzbekistan.

94
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:08,391
And than guys, I wanted to close this video talking about Upamano.

95
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,567
Talking about Upamekano because Upamekano is one of the big names out

96
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:14,261
of contact in summer twenty twenty-five, sorry in summer twenty twenty-six

97
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,949
and Bayern keep insisting.

98
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,817
Bayern remain in contact with the agents of UpaUpamecano, the agreement to extend

99
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,930
contract was very close around let's say end of March beginning of April.

100
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,384
Than they continue to discussos and at the moment they are still

101
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,831
working on that because obviously when you're getting closer to the

102
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,870
the the the the the actual contract,

103
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,550
it's also normal that other clubs, can start thinking about the opportunity

104
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:41,416
of an important defenderano.

105
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,939
Superano has to do.

106
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,045
he wants to stay at Bayern and reach an agreement final

107
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,004
details of salary with Bayern.

108
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,790
With Bayern Directors insisting a lot to keep- UpaUpamecano because they really

109
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,752
believe in him, because Vincent Company is a big fan of the player, Bayern

110
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,624
are pushing to extend this contract and their financial proposal is on the table,

111
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,644
O U Mano wants to listen clubs, there is interest from English, Spanish,

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,293
Italian clubs, obviously many big clubs are considering this opportunity.

113
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,615
But Bayern still have the ball in their court.

114
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,009
They have a proposal on the table, they are working on this.

115
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:21,526
And they are still talking with the agano, Bayern are busy with it.

116
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:26,072
But for sure it's gonna be an interesting situation to follow, because it's one

117
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:29,302
of the big names potentially available on a free in twenty twenty-six, depends

118
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:33,603
on Bayern had the opportunity to close the deal in April, they didn't because

119
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:37,595
there were some details to fix it went longer then expected, and when this

120
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:41,714
happens, it can happen clubs start trying to understand the situation.

121
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:45,805
But again at the moment Bayer still have the opportunity to

122
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,475
extend and that's they clear.

123
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,956
