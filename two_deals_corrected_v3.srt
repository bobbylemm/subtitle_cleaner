00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,894
and science a New Deal at the club.

15
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:05,175
Everything is completed
and it's an important.

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,770
News and important update
obviously for Spurs.

17
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,810
Talking about contrast guys, I
wanted to mention that there are some

18
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,930
updates on Frenkie de Jong, because

19
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,710
is set to sign contract at Barcelona.

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,090
leaving maybe Barca in summer twenty twenty-six, leaving as, um Every agent maybe after, so

21
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,660
in summer twenty twenty six, leaving
as, um Every agent maybe after, so

22
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,550
many stories on Frenkie de Jong always, but he is an important player.

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,190
Frenkie de Jong even when we had all the stories on Man United when he was the manager.

24
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,699
United when was the manager.

25
00:01:40,515 --> 00:01:45,285
Frenkie always wanted to stay at
Barcelona, he loves the club, he loves

26
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:48,915
in Barcelona, and now is really

27
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:53,335
important to play with this new idea of

28
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:56,335
So, Frenkie de Jong wants to stay, Frenkie de Jong signs a contract in Barcelona.

29
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:56,565
The deal agreement is done.

30
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:04,835
So now they are exchanging all the
documents lawyers player and clubside, to

31
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:06,395
get a new deal signed as soon as possible.

32
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:07,735
On clubside is already okay.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,919
So Barcelona already approved everything
and Counter signed everything,

34
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,420
depends on Frenkie de Jong the timing,
but the decision is already made.

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,359
will be valid until June twenty

36
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:25,200
twenty-nine, so Frenkie de Jong at Barcelona and everything verbally

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,960
agreed, so we just wait for the formal

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,560
the documents to be approved for the official statement, so all the procedure.

39
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,070
That follows a verbal agreement, but
Frenkie de Jong will be part of Barcelona

40
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,040
news for Barça, and especially a part

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,470
of the Deco project. I always mention

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,110
Barcelona, well now is a few years
that there, but he's doing an important

43
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,070
job on extending the contract, that's

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,070
um Just try to calculate how many

45
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:02,050
contracts they've extended in Barcelona.

46
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,940
Barcelona is really important to keep
control the players have at the club

47
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,540
to make sure they are comfortable

48
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,660
at the club and are correct

49
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,700
and so the deal is done for Frenkie de Jong.

50
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,560
De Jong.

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,600
My questions I'm getting guys is on
Man United and manager situation,

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,760
what happens if United lose this weekend?

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,270
Well, um guys at the moment
what I can tell you is that

54
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,790
Man United is not prepared.

55
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:30,345
Anything um in case
lose against Sunderland.

56
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:34,725
Man United don't have an agreement
with another coach, Man United have

57
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:38,545
not officially contacted any other
coach, Man United are not in

58
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:41,885
conversation in conversation with
Gareth Southgate despite the reports.

59
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:46,775
I told you several times, Southgate an
excellent relationship with Ios, but it

60
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:49,525
doesn't mean that is already agreed, it is
already advanced so that's the situation.

61
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,940
And at the moment for Manchester
United guys, I can tell you that

62
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,620
the situation is still the same.

63
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,540
Focus on the games, support Ruben Amorim,
try to get results because otherwise the

64
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,420
situation can't be safe for the Portuguese
manager, but at the moment my United has

65
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,975
not prepared something, So that Sunday
something can already happen if they lose

66
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:09,515
the game against Sunderland this weekend.

67
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:13,365
So Man United keep focusing on the
games and supporting the coach.

68
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:16,894
Then we have to see what happens but
at the moment they have not prepared,

69
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:20,935
an emergency a contingency plan in
case they lose the game this weekend.

70
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:25,205
So keep supporting Ruben
Amorim as their coach.

71
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:28,315
O Man United
guys um will not go to.

72
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,770
That's another update I can give you
in general on the manager's market,

73
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,500
because Aliti had thought of four
managers um to replace Laurent Blanc,

74
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,020
they had conversations with Luciano
Spalletti, they had conversations

75
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,620
with Xavi, they had conversations
with Roger Smith, former Benfica

76
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,490
Xavi

77
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:04,914
Sergio Conse race is Sergio Conse
immediately to an agreement on the

78
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:05,335
Sergio Fabio Cannavaro

79
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:06,034
Conse will be the boss of and that's
an important important club Etihad

80
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,924
after the league last season, coach
important players Karim Benzema,

81
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:17,045
um it's important to mention That
um for Xavi Hernandez, Premier

82
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:18,645
League remains an ideal destination.

83
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:23,435
Xavi, I can confront to you would love
to work in Premier League one day and

84
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:27,215
so that day is as soon as possible,
Xavi would be very happy about that.

85
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:30,865
Let's see what's gonna happen there, but
trust me Xavi is studying the Premier

86
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:34,305
League, Xavi is ready to return as
soon as possible, maybe it's gonna be in

87
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:35,825
Spain, in England, in Italy, whatever.

88
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,380
Xavis feels ready and
studying the Premier League.

89
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,770
So for sure um Xavi will be
more than happy to have an

90
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,900
opportunity in England, we see,

91
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,430
what's gonna happen there but the
manager mar continues to move.

92
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,050
Upamecano

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,350
I don't know if we have some Uzbekistan
friend on our channel on YouTube,

94
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,099
Fabio Cannavaro will be the new head
coach at the World Cup with Uzbekistan.

95
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,810
Upamecano

96
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,909
Upamecano

97
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:13,030
Upamecano

98
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,950
um and so Bayern keep insisting.

99
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,450
Upamecano

100
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,930
contract was very close around let's
say end of March beginning of April.

101
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,890
discussions

102
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,460
working on that because obviously
when you're getting closer to the

103
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,870
the actual contract

104
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,770
it's also normal that other clubs, can
start thinking about the opportunity

105
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,100
defender

106
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,990
Upamecano

107
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,240
He wants to stay at Bayern and reach a final agreement on details of salary with Bayern.

108
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,350
details of salary with Bayern.

109
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,400
With Bayern Directors insisting a lot
to keep- Upamecano because they really

110
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,860
believe in him, um because Vincent Company
is a big fan of the player, so Bayern

111
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,400
are pushing to extend this contract and
their financial proposal is on the table,

112
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,850
English, Spanish, Italian clubs

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,760
Italian clubs, so obviously many big
clubs are considering this opportunity.

114
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,080
But Bayern still have
the ball in their court.

115
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,800
They have a proposal on the
table, they are working on this.

116
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:18,725
agent

117
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:24,715
But for sure it's gonna be an interesting
situation to follow, um because it's one

118
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:29,075
in 2026

119
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:33,075
if Bayern had the opportunity

120
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:37,595
there were some details to fix it went
longer than expected, and when this

121
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:41,715
happens, it can happen clubs start
trying to understand the situation.

122
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,725
But again at the moment Bayer
still have the opportunity to

123
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,475
that's clear

124
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,260
