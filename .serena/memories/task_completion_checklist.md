# Task Completion Checklist

## Before Committing Code

### Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Run `black app/ tests/` to format code
- [ ] Run `isort app/ tests/` to sort imports  
- [ ] Run `ruff check app/ tests/` and fix any linting issues
- [ ] Run `mypy app/` and resolve type checking errors
- [ ] Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to ensure all hooks pass

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Write tests for new functionality in `tests/` directory
- [ ] Run `pytest` and ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Run `pytest --cov=app` to check test coverage
- [ ] Verify tests cover edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Test API endpoints with different input scenarios

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update docstrings for new/modified functions and classes
- [ ] Update API documentation if endpoints changed
- [ ] Update README.md if setup or usage instructions changed
- [ ] Update .env.sample if new environment variables added
- [ ] Add or update type hints for all functions

### Database Changes
- [ ] Create and test database migrations with `alembic revision --autogenerate`
- [ ] Test migration upgrade with `alembic upgrade head`
- [ ] Test migration downgrade with `alembic downgrade -1`
- [ ] Verify database schema changes in development environment
- [ ] Update database documentation if schema changed significantly

### Configuration & Environment
- [ ] Verify all new settings have defaults in `app/core/config.py`
- [ ] Add new environment variables to `.env.sample`
- [ ] Update Docker Compose configuration if needed
- [ ] Test configuration validation at startup
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not hardcoded

### API & Integration Testing
- [ ] Test API endpoints with curl or Postman
- [ ] Verify authentication and authorization work correctly
- [ ] Test rate limiting if applicable
- [ ] Verify error responses are properly formatted
- [ ] Test with different content types and edge cases

### Performance & Resource Management
- [ ] Check memory usage with large files
- [ ] Verify processing time meets performance targets
- [ ] Test concurrent request handling
- [ ] Monitor metrics endpoints for proper reporting
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in long-running processes

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Verify input validation for all API endpoints
- [ ] Check for potential security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Verify API key authentication works correctly
- [ ] Test file upload limits and validation

## Deployment Readiness

### Docker & Infrastructure
- [ ] Build Docker image successfully with `docker-compose build`
- [ ] Test full stack with `docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Verify health checks pass for all services
- [ ] Test service restart and recovery scenarios
- [ ] Check logs for errors or warnings

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Verify metrics are being collected properly
- [ ] Check logging output for appropriate detail level
- [ ] Test tracing if OpenTelemetry is enabled
- [ ] Verify health endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Monitor resource usage during testing

## Git & Version Control

### Commit Standards
- [ ] Write descriptive commit messages
- [ ] Ensure commits are atomic (single logical change)
- [ ] Squash fixup commits before merging
- [ ] Include issue/ticket numbers in commit messages if applicable

### Branch Management
- [ ] Work on feature branch, not main/master
- [ ] Rebase on latest main before creating PR
- [ ] Resolve any merge conflicts
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline passes

## Final Verification

### Integration Testing
