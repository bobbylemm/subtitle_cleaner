1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Okay,  so  I'm  pretty  sure  you
guys  have  seen  the  news  say  they

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,180
don't  arrest  this  guy,  General
Diyahu,  but  there's  a  problem  and

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,920
the  problem  lies  in  this  video.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,940
And  if  Opus  Odima  is  denying
that  he  did  not  have  any  meeting

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:23,000
with  Janto  and,  uh,  with  my
master  and  not  the  rest  of  the

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,560
commanders,  if  Opus  Odima  swell
over  this,  Opus  Odima  must  die.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,130
And  I  am  standing,  making
the  world  and  our  people

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,290
to  understand  the  kind  of
evil  man  that  Opus  Odima  is.

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,310
Standing  familiar,  standing  gidibam,
gidibam,  telling  our  people  this.

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,090
If  Opus  Odima  did  not  have
meeting  with  me  and  my  master,

11
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,269
with  other  commanders,  let  I
not  be  a...  Now,  after  watching

12
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:58,550
this  video,  my  question  is  this.

13
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:02,645
Did  the  Nigerian  army  arrest
General  Diyahu  because  of  all  the

14
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:06,245
atrocities  he  committed  or  because
he  did  not  start  to  call  names?

15
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:07,825
Do  you  understand?

16
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:11,005
Because  as  short  as  this  video,
this  video  carries  a  lot  of  weight.

17
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,565
Carries  a  lot  of  weight.

18
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:18,945
This  guy,  they  allege,  said  go  get
meeting  with  the  present  governor

19
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,765
of  Imo  State,  Hope  Odidika  Uzodima.

20
00:01:22,745 --> 00:01:23,245
Do  you  understand?

21
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:25,384
And  they  even  went  further
to  say,  Hope  Uzodima

22
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:26,365
should  come  out  and  swear.

23
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:31,365
Now,  I'm  curious  about  the  kind
of  meeting  that  the  governor

24
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:32,525
is  having  with  these  guys.

25
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:36,925
These  guys  that  are  being  linked
with  kidnapping  and  buying  of  people.

26
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:41,185
He  even  went  further  to  say,  Opozo
Nima,  the  meeting  with  him  and

27
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,845
other  commanders  with  the  master.

28
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:43,525
Boom!

29
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,685
Now  they  don't  arrest  the  guy.

30
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:46,705
It's  suspicious,  right?

31
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:48,305
It's  suspicious.

32
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:50,765
Now,  what  if  you  say,  let's
say  these  guys  start  to  talk

33
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:51,745
because  they  don't  betray  her.

34
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,495
Maybe  one  agreement  is  not  going
the  way  it's  supposed  to  be.

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,620
But  yeah,  they  say
they  don't  arrest  them.

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,220
But  again,  another  thing  is  this.

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,760
Was  there  really  terrorism?

38
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,080
Most  of  these  guys,  nah
sponsor,  did  they  sponsor  them?

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,780
I  don't  watch,  you  see
this  general  at  Yahoo?

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,260
Are  they  watching  videos?

41
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,200
Steady.

42
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,039
You  gon'  know  say  this  guy,
nah  sponsor,  they  sponsor  him.

43
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,400
There's  nothing  like  it.

44
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,380
You  gon'  know  say
they  sponsor  the  guy.

45
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:14,820
Do  you  understand?

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,440
You  won't  know.

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,940
It's  clear.

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,440
It's  clear  on  all  his  videos.

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,200
Go  and  watch  them.

50
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,360
Do  you  understand?

51
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,100
It's  clear.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,540
Now  make  it  make  sense.

53
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,040
How  did  this  guy  get
this  kind  of  gun?

54
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,820
For  his  sidebush?

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,260
How?

56
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,060
Shit,  did  he  plug  gun  for  three?

57
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,104
They  block  bullets  for  three.

58
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:33,685
There  are  a  lot  of  questions
that  when  you  answer,  when  you

59
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:37,265
ask,  if  you  connect  all  the  dots,
you  will  understand  that  a  lot

60
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:38,524
of  these  things  are  not  real.

61
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:43,245
What  people  don't  understand  is  that
just  the  way,  if  they  ask  you,

62
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:45,305
what  do  you  do  for  a  living,  right?

63
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:46,865
You  say,  oh,  I  am  a  banker.

64
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:48,164
I  am  an  entrepreneur.

65
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:52,165
That's  how  some  people's
business  is  Nigeria.

66
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:54,964
What  do  you  do  for  a  living?

67
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:56,844
Nigeria  is  what  they
do  for  a  living.

68
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:00,225
To  cause  problem  and  to  make
sure  Nigeria  does  not  work.

69
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:03,565
And  that's  how  they  make  their
own  money  and  benefit  from  it.

70
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:06,505
And  I'm  talking  about
politics,  politicians.

71
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:09,685
Do  you  understand?

72
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:13,045
Now  let's  go  back  again,  where
this  guy  get  all  these  guns  from?

73
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:16,785
All  these  gun  guns,  na  army  if
you  bring  them  come  this  country.

74
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:21,025
Na  army  if  you  bring  all  these
guns  come  this  country,  or  police.

75
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:22,644
Na  military  in  general.

76
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,565
So  how  did  it  get  to  his  hand?

77
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:27,005
That's  another  thing.

78
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,420
This  guy  don't  commit.

79
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,540
Now,  there's  a  particular  video
where  he  go  viral  at  that  time.

80
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,300
Where  he  said  three
guys,  they  for  ground.

81
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,399
Him  blast  them,  Yoshi  shoot  them.

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,779
No  tool,  no  wear  cloth  for  ground.

83
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,820
And  no  one  just  played  the  video
because  of  community  guidelines.

84
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,519
Now,  in  that  video,
he  face  no  show.

85
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,959
The  guy  face  no  show,  but
if  you  hear  the  voice,  the

86
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,859
voice  actually  did  similar.

87
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:49,700
Right?

88
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:53,984
So  this  guy  don't  commit
one  or  two  things  since.

89
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:58,185
When  I  don't  link  him  to  insurgency,
eh,  eh,  eh,  eh,  eh,  eh,  kidnapping

90
00:03:58,185 --> 00:03:59,605
and  all  but  I  don't  go  carry  on.

91
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:01,565
He  start  to  call  names
now  and  they  go  carry  on.

92
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:02,685
That's  number  one.

93
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:06,645
Number  two,  obviously  I'll  give
him  a  peace  deal  as  well.

94
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:10,584
Because  even  I  think  if  that
guy  forecasting  a  peace  deal,

95
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,464
there's  nothing  people  cannot
do  again  in  this  country.

96
00:04:15,765 --> 00:04:18,904
You  are  giving  a  man  that  has  been
linked  to  quite  a  lot  of  civilians

97
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:20,425
in  Nigeria,  a  lot  of  citizens.

98
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:21,405
Nigeria.

99
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:24,345
Both  women  and  children.

100
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,205
That's  where  they
link  to  kidnappings.

101
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,165
That's  where  we  say  in  all
of  these,  a  lot  of  lives  of

102
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:35,545
our  own  Nigerian  army,  our
own  military  men  go  down.

103
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,730
They  give  her  a  big  steal
and  they  watch  the  video.

104
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,730
I  just  they  shake  my  head.

105
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,870
That's  why  you  pack  cartridge
pack  bullets  full  body  They

106
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,390
talk  and  they  watch  them.

107
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,410
I  just  they  shake  and  they  laugh.

108
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,850
I  say  no  if  you  look  at  it
critically  you  will  understand

109
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,470
That  when  they  tell  you  that
there's  insurgency  in  nigeria.

110
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,650
Yes  We  have  to  quote  it  like  that
one  wants  to  make  our  video  Do  you

111
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,770
understand  or  want  to  talk  against
it  or  want  to  talk  about  it?

112
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,630
But  do  these  things  really  exist?

113
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,375
Do  you  understand?

114
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,735
They  say,  oh,  they  go
arrest  one  kidnapper.

115
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,074
They  go  arrest  one,
eh,  Boko  Haram  member.

116
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,434
Who  brought  them  in  before?

117
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:20,275
Who  bring  Boko  Haram  before?

118
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:21,174
Who  bring  them  in?

119
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:26,315
The  only  time  where  all  these
politicians  want  me  to  pipe  by

120
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:29,995
those  boys,  now  when  those  boys
don't  rebel  against  them,  when

121
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,495
the  boys  don't  get  carried  away,
the  tools  where  they  bring,

122
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:34,775
where  they  will  take  use  of
them  to  do  politics  for  them.

123
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,575
The  boys  don't  start  to  use
them  for  their  own  thing.

124
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:39,215
At  that  time,  the  government
didn't  do  anything.

125
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:40,975
But  anyways,  we  are  not
going  to  talk  about  that.

126
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:43,175
My  own  bise,  the  question  is  this.

127
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:47,095
She  will  not  arrest  General
Diyahu  because  he  don't

128
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:48,375
commit  a  lot  of  atrocities.

129
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:49,674
We  are  going  to  link  his  name  too.

130
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,494
Or  because  he  don't  start
to  call  names  when  he

131
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:53,215
is  not  supposed  to  call.

132
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:55,414
You  know,  that's  just
my  harmless  question.

133
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:59,155
Or  is  it  that  he  is
lying  against  the  governor?

134
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,460
is  it  possible  that  the  governor
did  not  have  any  meeting  with  him

135
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,680
or  he's  just  lying  or  he's  just
saying  it  like  i  want  to  know  i'm

136
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,060
really  curious  what  meeting  is  he
talking  about  what  was  discussed

137
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:17,099
in  this  meeting  you  know  it  is
to  ask  bro  this  country  anyways
