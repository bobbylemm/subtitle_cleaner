1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,058
I'm pretty sure you guys have seen the news say they

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,324
don't arrest this guy, Gentle De Yahoo, but there's a problem and

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,003
the problem lies in this video.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:15,940
And if Hope Uzodinma is denying that he did not have any meeting

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:23,000
with Janto and, with my master and not the rest of the

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,560
commanders, if Hope Uzodinma swell over this, Hope Uzodinma must die.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,130
And I am standing, making the world and our people

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,306
to understand the kind of evil man that Hope Uzodinma is.

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,310
Standing familiar, standing gidibam, gidibam, telling our people this.

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,090
If Hope Uzodinma did not have meeting with me and my master,

11
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,269
with other commanders, let I not be aâ€¦ Now, after watching

12
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:59,151
this video, my question is this.

13
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:02,645
Did the Nigerian Army army arrest Gentle De Yahoo because of all the

14
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:06,527
atrocities he committed or because he did not start to call names?

15
00:01:07,385 --> 00:01:08,443
Do you understand?

16
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:11,886
Because as short as this video, this video carries a lot of weight.

17
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,565
Carries a lot of weight.

18
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:19,345
This guy, they allege, said go get meeting with the present governor

19
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:23,245
of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma Uzodima. Do you understand?

20
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:26,129
And they even went further to say, Hope Uzodinma

21
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:31,365
should come out and swear. Now, I'm curious about the kind

22
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:32,894
is having with these guys.

23
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:36,925
These guys that are being linked with kidnapping and buying of people.

24
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:42,268
He even went further to say, Hope Uzodinma, the meeting with him and

25
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,126
other commanders with the master.

26
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:43,624
Boom!

27
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,389
Now they don't arrest the guy.

28
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:48,305
It's suspicious, It's suspicious.

29
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:52,039
Now, what if you say, let's say these guys start to talk

30
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:52,529
because they don't betray her.

31
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:55,413
Maybe one agreement is not going the way it's supposed to be.

32
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,977
But they say they don't arrest them.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,641
But again, another thing is this.

34
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,208
Was there really terrorism?

35
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,095
Most of these guys, nah sponsor, did they sponsor them?

36
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,847
I don't watch, you see this Gentle De Yahoo?

37
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,640
Are they watching videos?

38
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,360
Steady.

39
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,170
You gon' know say this guy, nah sponsor, they sponsor him.

40
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,559
There's nothing it.

41
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,854
You gon' know say they sponsor the guy.

42
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,518
Do you understand?

43
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,822
You won't know.

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,207
It's clear.

45
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,745
It's clear on all his videos.

46
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,040
Go and watch them.

47
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,838
Do you understand?

48
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,799
It's clear.

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,152
Now make it make sense.

50
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,855
How did this guy get this kind of gun?

51
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,180
For his sidebush?

52
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,060
How? Shit, did he plug gun for three?

53
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,104
They block bullets for three.

54
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:34,975
There are a lot of questions that when you answer, when you

55
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:37,449
ask, if you connect all the dots, you will understand that a lot

56
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:38,970
of these things are not real.

57
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:43,905
What people don't understand is that just the way, if they ask you,

58
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:45,305
what do you do for a living,

59
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:46,985
You say, I am a banker.

60
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:48,664
I am an entrepreneur.

61
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:52,291
That's how some people's business is Nigerian Army.

62
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:55,412
What do you do for a living?

63
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:57,441
Nigerian Army is what they do for a living.

64
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:00,279
To cause problem and to make sure Nigerian Army does not work.

65
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:04,653
And that's how they make their own money and benefit from it.

66
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:07,112
And I'm talking about politics, politicians.

67
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,544
Do you understand?

68
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:14,309
Now let's go back again, where this guy get all these guns from?

69
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:17,229
All these gun guns, na army if you bring them come this country.

70
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:22,048
Na army if you bring all these guns come this country, or police.

71
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:23,085
Na military in general.

72
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,833
how did it get to his hand?

73
00:03:26,084 --> 00:03:29,420
That's another thing. This guy don't commit.

74
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:33,544
Now, there's a particular video where he go viral at that time.

75
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,129
Where he said three guys, they for ground.

76
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,641
Him blast them, Yoshi shoot them.

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
No tool, no wear cloth for ground.

78
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,023
And no one just played the video because of community guidelines.

79
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,097
Now, in that video, he face no show.

80
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:48,177
The guy face no show, but if you hear the voice, the

81
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,700
voice did similar.

82
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:53,984
this guy don't commit one or two things since.

83
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:58,185
When I don't link him to insurgency, kidnapping

84
00:03:58,185 --> 00:04:00,067
and all but I don't go carry on.

85
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:02,768
He start to call names now and they go carry on.

86
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:02,863
That's number one.

87
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:06,645
Number two, obviously I'll give him a peace deal as

88
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:11,476
Because even I think if that guy forecasting a peace deal,

89
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,620
there's nothing people cannot do again in this country.

90
00:04:15,765 --> 00:04:19,823
You are giving a man that has been linked to quite a lot of civilians

91
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:20,668
in Nigerian Army, a lot of citizens.

92
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:24,345
Nigerian Army. Both women and children.

93
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,400
That's where they link to kidnappings.

94
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,301
That's where we say in all of these, a lot of lives of

95
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:35,545
our own Nigerian Army army, our own military men go down.

96
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,730
They give her a big steal and they watch the video.

97
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,379
I just they shake my head.

98
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,242
That's why you pack cartridge pack bullets full body They

99
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,390
talk and they watch them.

100
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,431
I just they shake and they laugh.

101
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,850
I say no if you look at it critically you will understand

102
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,320
That when they tell you that there's insurgency in Nigerian Army.

103
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,275
Yes We have to quote it that one wants to make our video Do you

104
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,355
understand or want to talk against it or want to talk about it?

105
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,071
But do these things really exist?

106
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,375
Do you understand?

107
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:14,289
They say, they go arrest one kidnapper.

108
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,210
They go arrest one, Boko Haram member.

109
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,963
Who brought them in before?

110
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:20,821
Who bring Boko Haram before?

111
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:21,914
Who bring them in?

112
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:27,764
The only time where all these politicians want me to pipe by

113
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:29,995
those boys, now when those boys don't rebel against them, when

114
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:33,524
the boys don't get carried away, the tools where they bring,

115
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:35,947
where they will take use of them to do politics for them.

116
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,992
The boys don't start to use them for their own thing.

117
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:40,518
At that time, the government didn't do anything.

118
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:42,297
But anyways, we are not going to talk about that.

119
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:43,355
My own bise, the question is this.

120
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:47,095
She will not arrest Gentle De Yahoo because he don't

121
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:48,683
commit a lot of atrocities.

122
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,554
We are going to link his name too.

123
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:53,238
Or because he don't start to call names when he

124
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:53,905
is not supposed to call.

125
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:56,103
You know, that's just my harmless question.

126
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:59,155
Or is it that he is lying against the governor?

127
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,282
is it possible that the governor did not have any meeting with him

128
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,680
or he's just lying or he's just saying it i want to know i'm

129
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,562
really curious what meeting is he talking about what was discussed

130
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:17,099
in this meeting you know it is to ask bro this country anyways
