3. Problem: With no meta description
Report file: no_meta_description.csv
Description: Meta descriptions can significantly increase the chance of someone clicking on your content in the search results. The meta description lets people know what to expect on the page they are about to open. If you choose not to add an optimized and intriguing meta description, the search engine will typically add the first sentence of the page. Usually, that will not be enough to pique the interest of the person searching and they might not click.
Solution: Go through your site content and add relevant and unique meta descriptions to each page to increase your chances of intriguing searchers to click through to your content.
