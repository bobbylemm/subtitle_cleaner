# Authentication

The API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in your dashboard (coming soon).

## Using your API Key

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication to the API is performed via the \`X-API-Key\` header.

```bash {{ title: 'cURL Example' }}
curl https://subtitlecleaner.chidozienwoga.workers.dev/api/v1/universal/universal-correct \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@movie.srt"
```

All API requests must be made over **HTTPS**. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## Errors

If you provide an invalid or missing API key, the API will return a `403 Forbidden` error.

```json {{ title: 'Error Response' }}
{
  "detail": "Could not validate credentials"
}
```
