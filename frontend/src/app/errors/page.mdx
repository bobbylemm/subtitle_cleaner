# Errors

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

## Status Codes

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `200` | **OK** - The request was successful. |
| `400` | **Bad Request** - The request was invalid (e.g., missing file, invalid parameters). |
| `401` | **Unauthorized** - No API key provided. |
| `403` | **Forbidden** - Invalid API key. |
| `413` | **Payload Too Large** - The file uploaded is too large. |
| `422` | **Unprocessable Entity** - Validation error (e.g., wrong file format). |
| `500` | **Internal Server Error** - Something went wrong on our end. |

## Error Response Format

All errors return a JSON object with a `detail` field explaining what went wrong.

```json {{ title: 'Example Error' }}
{
  "detail": "File format not supported. Please upload .srt or .vtt files."
}
```
