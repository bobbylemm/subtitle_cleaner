# Getting Started

The **Clean Subtitle API** allows you to programmatically clean, correct, and standardize subtitle files (SRT, VTT) using advanced LLM-powered context analysis.

It goes beyond simple spell-checking by understanding the **context** of the video (Topic, Industry, Country) to preserve slang, nicknames, and technical terms while fixing genuine errors.

## Features

-   **Context-Aware Correction:** Uses GPT-4o to analyze the full text and understand the domain before making changes.
-   **Style Preservation:** Keeps the speaker's authentic voice, including slang and informal language.
-   **Multi-Format Support:** Works with `.srt` and `.vtt` files.
-   **Diff Generation:** Returns a detailed list of changes for transparency.

## Next Steps

To start using the API, you'll need an API key. See the [Authentication](/authentication) guide for details.
