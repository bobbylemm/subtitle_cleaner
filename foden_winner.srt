1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,000
Look, a win is a win for Manchester City

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,439
today, but I think this is one of those

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,160
wins that massively covers up the cracks

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,919
in this team. This is one of those wins

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,599
that you take the three points, but you

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,160
look at and say that was shocking. That

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,759
second half from Medster City is up

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,519
there with one of the worst performances

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,600
from a pep side I have seen in a half.

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,279
Honestly, I know last season they went

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,039
on that terrible losing run. I know in

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,080
the past as well too, they have

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,439
struggled. They haven't always been

14
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,519
perfect, but that's up there with or

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,359
rather down there with the worst I have

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,119
seen from a Guardiola team play.

17
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,880
Guardiola mentioned during the week

18
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,640
about wanting to see bravery from his

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,320
team. That loss against Leverkus and for

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,000
him even more damning than one against

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,680
Newcastle because he felt his side

22
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,960
didn't take enough risk. They didn't

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
show enough bravery on the ball to get

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,640
on it and make things happen and take

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,239
the game to the opposition. On the basis

26
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,600
of the first half, you would have

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,039
thought that his team definitely took

28
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,480
those words on board because they were

29
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,239
comfortable. Within a minute, Phil Foden

30
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,920
scoring a goal very similar to the one

31
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,280
he actually missed against Newcastle,

32
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,520
but this time getting good contact on it

33
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,360
to put his side up 1 nil after 40

34
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,719
seconds. And then shortly after,

35
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,039
Guardiola off a set piece bundling the

36
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,199
ball over the line after a bit of a

37
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,518
mishap from Leeds. And this game could

38
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,200
have very well been three or four nil

39
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,799
after the first half for Man City. As

40
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,080
you would typically expect, right? When

41
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
you see Man City playing at at home to

42
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
Leads, you expect that is a

43
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,040
straightforward, easy, take the three

44
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,400
points and just go home before ball is

45
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,680
even kicked. But then in the second

46
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
half, the ugly side of this City team

47
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,080
reared its ugly head. And it happened

48
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,400
very, very quickly. 5 minutes into the

49
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
second half. One of the worst defensive

50
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,080
mistakes you will see from a top side

51
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,400
this season in any league across Europe.

52
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,840
Guardial Nunes Nunez. Honestly, it's

53
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,439
just an absolute calamity from

54
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,040
Manchester City's defenders in a

55
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
situation where they really weren't in

56
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,560
any danger until they actually put

57
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
themselves in the danger. And Nunz in

58
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,680
particular, I don't think covers himself

59
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,759
in any kind of glory in this in this

60
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,200
moment. And to be honest with you, I

61
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,560
thought throughout the game, showed

62
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,399
tremendous weakness out there and maybe

63
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,000
reaffirms the belief that Manchester

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
City do need a right back going forward.

65
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
I know he's actually had a pretty decent

66
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
season over the course of this year, but

67
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
I think if City are serious about

68
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,799
challenging in every single competition,

69
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,040
like they typically do, Nunez is not the

70
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
level for Manchester City right back.

71
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
Not in my opinion. Cal Lewen capitalizes

72
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,479
on the mistake 2-1 to Manchester City.

73
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
But these are moments where in the past

74
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,239
few seasons you would see Man City

75
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,480
concede a goal. But rather than just

76
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,319
panic and lose their minds, no, what Man

77
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,760
City would do is get on the ball, put

78
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,360
their foot on it, slow the game down to

79
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
their tempo, and dictate the way the

80
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,720
rest of the game went because they

81
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
weren't afraid of conceding more. They

82
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,920
weren't afraid of what the opposition

83
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,840
could do to them because they knew the

84
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,440
quality that they had that could punish

85
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
them. That was the old Manchester City

86
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
where the likes of De Bruyne and Silva

87
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,599
and Fernandinho and Rodri when he was

88
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,000
fit. That's the Man City that went on to

89
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,239
win 12, 13 games in a row on course to

90
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,519
winning a Premier League title. But the

91
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,879
problem with this Man City team is at

92
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,640
the slightest sign of adversity, you do

93
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
feel like they are susceptible to

94
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,080
crumbling. I question the mentality of

95
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
this team. I don't really question the

96
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
talent of this team, but I do question

97
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,440
the mentality of this side. Do they

98
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,040
actually believe that they're good

99
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,480
enough to win a Premier League title?

100
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,519
Because on the basis of that second

101
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,280
half, I have to question that from a lot

102
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,440
of them. And the second goal that they

103
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,319
concede, Guardio sliding in the way he

104
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,239
did. Vardio scored a goal, was playing

105
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
decent, and then commits these stupid

106
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,680
mistakes that you just think to

107
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,040
yourself, Vardio, you're way better than

108
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,879
that. You're way better than that. It's

109
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
such a boneheaded tackle going directly

110
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
through Calvert Leuen. It's a stone cold

111
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,159
stonewall penalty. Obviously, Meta takes

112
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,760
the penalty. Donnaruma makes a really

113
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,440
good save and then the follow-up is

114
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,760
easy. It's a tap in 22. And on top of

115
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,200
that, it wasn't it's not bad enough that

116
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
they gave up a twogoal lead to make it

117
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,360
2-2. Even at 2-2 leads looked like the

118
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,599
side for a bit that were pushing for a

119
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,280
winner. They were the side that actually

120
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,360
had more possession after 60 minutes in

121
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
that second half than Man City at the

122
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,680
Etihad. This is for me shocking. It's

123
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,440
absolutely shocking to see a lead side

124
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
who have been so distinctly average

125
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,599
throughout this year playing away at one

126
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,440
of the toughest grounds supposedly to go

127
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
to in the Prem and actually taking the

128
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
game to Man City even at 22. And

129
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,040
genuinely I think City are very very

130
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,640
fortunate with how the second half went

131
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
in that they never conceded the third

132
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
because at times it was disgraceful for

133
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,560
a side with title aspirations like we've

134
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,239
labeled the City team. Some of the play

135
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,319
in that second half was as poor as you

136
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,040
can get. Now where it all started to go

137
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,439
left for for leads was towards the last

138
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,280
5 to 10 minutes of the game and then of

139
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,680
course in extra time leads started to

140
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
retreat a little bit. Leads started to

141
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,479
secede possession a little bit. they

142
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,240
started to drop deeper and Manchester

143
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,600
City start to get a foothold in the

144
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,759
game. And we know the minute you start

145
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,360
allowing Man City to get a hold of the

146
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
ball and then dictating the way they

147
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,560
want to play, it's only a matter of

148
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
time. And then when you saw 10 minutes

149
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,080
added on on the board, come on. It it

150
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,759
almost felt like City were going to grab

151
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,120
grab a goal. But the goal that Phil

152
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
Fodden scores today is sensational.

153
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,240
That's a fantastic goal. And the timing

154
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
of it as well too is is ridiculous. But

155
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
Cherokee looks up, sees Foden in in a

156
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
good amount of space. Fodin receives the

157
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
ball almost on the H like across his

158
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,000
body. Allah Foden, we know that's his

159
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
specialty, right? But Leed's players

160
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,320
quickly close in on him. So the angle to

161
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,880
shoot is almost immediately destructed,

162
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,560
right? But Phil Foden shows all his

163
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
brilliant quality in this move. I think

164
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
first and foremost, like I said, to

165
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,000
receive it across his body, take that

166
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
touch and then have the footwork, have

167
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
the agility as well too to maneuver his

168
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,320
his way, maneuver the space to even

169
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,400
craft what in my opinion is a half

170
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
chance. that finish that he pulls off is

171
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,080
a half chance, man. He's not even fully

172
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,520
facing the goal. He's got bodies in

173
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
front of him. He's damn near on the edge

174
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,360
of the box and then to find an opening

175
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
the way he does with that finish.

176
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
Nothing Lucas Perry in the goal can do.

177
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
I think that's one of the best goals of

178
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
the season personally. And this is why I

179
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,960
continue to say Phil Foden. There's

180
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
numerous angles you can maybe look at

181
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,080
and criticize him for. I don't think

182
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,000
he's had a a perfect career today, but

183
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,320
one thing I can never ever ever doubt is

184
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,000
Phil Foden's talent. And in that moment

185
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
right there, it was on full display.

186
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,759
That is a fantastic goal, a fantastic

187
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,840
moment of individual brilliance to not

188
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,520
only get his team a win, but to save

189
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
their blushes and maybe save any little

190
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,680
title aspirations they do have because

191
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
at the moment, every game for City feels

192
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,039
like a must-win. When you look at the

193
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,039
form Arsenal are in at the moment in all

194
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,720
competitions, you look at the the mood

195
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,320
around that camp, you look at the

196
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,759
inevitability that they seem to be

197
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,319
displaying on a game-to-ame basis. As

198
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,240
Manchester City, you cannot afford to

199
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,880
slip up at any point, let alone playing

200
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,560
at home to leads. That has to be a

201
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,120
gimme. That has to be three easy points.

202
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,360
Game over before it even starts. They

203
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,919
made a very, very light situation

204
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,840
extremely difficult today. And they have

205
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,759
they have to anybody affiliated with

206
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,520
City today has to go and buy Phil Foden

207
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,120
dinner tonight because he's saved you

208
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
guys. But again, I don't think this is a

209
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,800
case of quality because you look at the

210
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,160
quality of Manchester City's players and

211
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,919
you look at the quality of leads and

212
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,600
it's night and day, right? No one would

213
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,240
dare say leads have as good players as

214
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,639
City. No one would dare say Daniel Farca

215
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,400
is on the same caliber of manager as Pep

216
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,080
Guardiola, but I'm telling you, I think

217
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,759
with City right now, it's a mentality

218
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,960
thing. I know I'm not saying they're as

219
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,800
good as Arsenal, right? But for me, the

220
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,160
the results over the last three weeks,

221
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,520
rather the performances over the last

222
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,960
three weeks, maybe especially the two

223
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,080
because I think Newcastle, they did

224
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,280
contest, they did have a few chances,

225
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,319
they could have easily won that game,

226
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,919
right? But the last two games, I'm just

227
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,360
looking at City at times and I'm like, I

228
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,039
don't know if they in their heart of

229
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,680
hearts believe that they have what it

230
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,199
takes to win the league. And it's kind

231
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,639
of why at the start of the season I said

232
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,840
I think City potentially have the

233
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,919
highest ceiling of any team if they can

234
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,599
kind of get everything clicking. But

235
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,919
also it's why I believe they're maybe a

236
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,639
year away from actually being a serious

237
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,000
Premier League contender. They're going

238
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,840
to contend, right? But can they go all

239
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,039
the way? I think they're a year away

240
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,160
from that. And it's not because I feel

241
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
like they have to buy six new players. I

242
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,720
feel like it's just they don't have

243
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,080
enough players that are ready for prime

244
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,120
time. They don't have enough players

245
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,360
that have been through numerous title

246
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,800
races. They have some obviously some

247
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
guys have won Premier Leagues for them,

248
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,120
but I think the players that they're

249
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,639
trying to incorporate into this team to

250
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,880
almost bow out the old guard, I don't

251
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,800
think they're ready yet to be going on,

252
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,039
like I said, 12, 13 game winning runs

253
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,880
like City usually do to then win the

254
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
Premier League at the end of the season.

255
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm going to be honest, Tajani Rinders,

256
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,199
who looked so fantastic against Wolves

257
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,440
on opening day, has looked pretty

258
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,199
unremarkable since, and this is a player

259
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,280
I do rate, but I think he has massively

260
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,440
struggled to kind of get a run of games,

261
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,759
get a run of performances together. uh

262
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,520
and in fact he's pretty much lost his

263
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,879
spot over the last few weeks as City

264
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,319
have decided to go Niko Gonzalez and

265
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,240
Bernardo as a as a deeper two rather

266
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
than Riners and he got his opportunity

267
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,080
today from the start against leads and I

268
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,360
don't think he took it well enough

269
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,199
whatsoever. I think Bernardo Silva had a

270
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,039
poor game in my opinion and I think by

271
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,879
the way his dive I think he's extremely

272
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
fortunate not to get a second yellow. I

273
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,160
think if he's not on a yellow already

274
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
they're giving him a yellow. That's a

275
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
terrible dive and they had V on top of

276
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,599
that to look at it. I think he caught

277
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,440
life today. Erling Howland tried and he

278
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,800
tried. He didn't have his best game at

279
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,599
all, but this is I I know we talked

280
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,199
about last week, can City win when he

281
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,800
doesn't score. They got it done today,

282
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
but I think still there is that question

283
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,800
mark about who can cons consistently

284
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,560
step up if Halen isn't scoring goals.

285
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Foden did a fantastic job of that today,

286
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,159
but they still do need more. I thought

287
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,159
Douku had a pretty unremarkable game as

288
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,760
well too. I think leadeds his right back

289
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,839
did a pretty decent job of him despite

290
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,760
him still having that cross that Marmush

291
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
should have scored at the end. But for

292
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
me, the story for City today is the

293
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,360
defense. All four of those guys, Nunz,

294
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,080
O'Reilly, Vardial, and Diaz from a

295
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,519
defensive point of view, not from a

296
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,640
going forward, not from creating

297
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,160
chances, not from scoring goals, from

298
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,839
just old-fashioned defending point of

299
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,839
view today is unacceptable. And I think

300
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,959
they have to look at Donnaruma a little

301
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,640
bit because I think he saved them a on a

302
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,080
few occasions. And I think Donnaruma was

303
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,680
extremely unlucky to concede two goals

304
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,839
today. And I think they have to to owe a

305
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,200
big apology to their forwards as well,

306
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,040
too. That back four nearly cost

307
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,480
Manchester City three points today.

308
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
Guardiola, if we know him well enough,

309
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
and we do, he's a fierce competitor, but

310
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
he's also a perfectionist. He will not

311
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
be happy with that three points today. I

312
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,839
know on on face value, they got the win.

313
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,360
But I'm telling you, Guardiola in the

314
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
dressing room after that game is letting

315
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
his team have it because in the position

316
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
of complete control that they were in

317
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,320
before a ball was kicked or before a

318
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
second half was kicked to that second

319
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,920
half, my goodness, I I struggle to see

320
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,600
what went wrong, what was said at

321
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,959
halftime, what happened to the

322
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
mentality? Horrible. And now all eyes

323
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
look forward to tomorrow. And again,

324
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,000
this is why this folding goal is so huge

325
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,519
because I think if Man City draw this

326
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,959
game, forget about even lose it, but if

327
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,800
they draw this game, we're an Arsenal

328
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,880
win tomorrow away at Stanford Bridge

329
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,720
from saying the title is over, right?

330
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,040
I'm not a fan of City. I'm not a fan of

331
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,800
Arsenal. I'm not a fan of Chelsea. Not a

332
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,000
fan of Liverpool, but I'm a fan of

333
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
competition. It's why last season I was

334
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,000
so frustrated with Arsenal because I

335
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
want to see Premier League title races

336
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
that are contested by at least two

337
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,760
teams, let alone three or four. I want

338
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,120
to see what we're calling the best

339
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
league in the world. I want to see that

340
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,000
at the top level. And I think last

341
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,920
season we had no title race whatsoever.

342
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
Liverpool in my opinion had that one by

343
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,839
January, February time. This season

344
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,680
Arsenal are brilliant and they deserve

345
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,240
to win it if they do, but I still want

346
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,320
to see a side go toe-to-toe with them or

347
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,560
at least keep the distance, keep pace

348
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,320
with them, keep keep them honest. You

349
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,200
know what I mean? I don't want to see

350
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,079
Arsenal after 20 games, they're all but

351
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,279
mathematically winners. Now they're

352
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,720
putting out second teams. I don't want

353
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,480
to see that. I want to see a team really

354
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,240
give them a go, if not two, if not

355
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,000
three. So for Manchester City, I don't

356
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
have any dog in this fight here, right?

357
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
I don't have any horse in this race, but

358
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
I do want to see other teams give

359
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,519
Arsenal a go this year. At the moment,

360
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,360
City probably look like the most likely

361
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,800
we're going to see Chelsea tomorrow as

362
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,399
well, too, cuz they've quietly kind of

363
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,760
got under the radar and find themselves

364
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,480
in second ahead of tomorrow's game. But

365
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,160
the question is, can Arsenal continue

366
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,680
their winning run or their unbeaten run

367
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
rather? It is a winning run at this

368
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,959
point. I think the last lost, not to be

369
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,480
fair, they dropped points to Sunderland.

370
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
or can Chelsea's big game heroics

371
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,480
continue and can Moresca get another big

372
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,800
result this time against Mikuel Arteta?

373
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
All to play for. Can't wait for

374
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,160
tomorrow's game. I'm also watching PSG

375
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,680
Monaco at at the moment as well too. So,

376
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,040
we'll have a review for that tomorrow in

377
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,000
our European segment. But Man City, you

378
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,399
guys caught life, man. Don't Wow, that

379
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,720
was risky, man. That That was close.

380
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,319
I'll see you guys soon. Peace.
